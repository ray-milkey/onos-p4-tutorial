o Session 3: IPv6 routing

This session will focus on adding support for routing of IPv6 packets between
different ToR switches.

Students will have to modify their P4 program and
ONOS app to handle IPv6 NDP Router Advertisement and Solicitation
messages, as well as programming of P4 table entries and action profile
groups to route packets across the fabric, using ECMP to distribute traffic
between multiple spines.
