Session 2: Bridging

In this session students will have to extend both the P4 code and ONOS app
to add support for L2 bridging for hosts connected to the same top of rack
(ToR) switch, including host learning based on cloning of ARP/NDP packets,
and set up of L2 forwarding entries.

The lesson will cover concepts such as
writing ONOS apps that react to events such as switch and host discovery,
and programming of P4 table entries and packet replication groups.
